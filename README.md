# ATM Interface Project

This project was developed during my Python Development internship at Octanet Pvt Ltd. It is a simple ATM system implemented using Python and tkinter for the graphical user interface.

## Features
- **Account Creation**: Users can create a new account by entering their user ID and PIN.
- **Login**: Users can log in to their account using their user ID and PIN.
- **View Balance**: Once logged in, users can view their current balance.
- **Withdraw Money**: Users can withdraw money from their account, with the system checking for sufficient balance.
- **Deposit Money**: Users can deposit money into their account.
- **Transfer Money**: Users can transfer money to another account, with the system checking for sufficient balance and verifying the recipient's account.

## Implementation Details
- **GUI**: The project used tkinter for the graphical user interface, with windows for different actions like account creation, login, and transactions.
- **Data Storage**: User accounts were stored in memory during runtime, with no persistent storage for simplicity.
- **Error Handling**: The system handled errors such as insufficient balance or invalid user IDs/PINs using tkinter messagebox alerts.
- **Security**: The project did not implement advanced security features like encryption, as it was a basic simulation.

## Repository Structure
- **atm_interface.py**: Main Python script containing the ATM class and GUI implementation.
- **README.md**: This file, providing an overview of the project.
- **LICENSE**: License information for the project.
- **requirements.txt**: List of required Python packages for running the project.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/RushiK134/Octanet_Python_Development_Internship_Project.git`
2. Install the required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the `atm_interface.py` script to start the ATM system.

## Internship Experience
During this internship, I gained hands-on experience in Python development, GUI programming with tkinter, and collaborative remote work. The project provided practical exposure to building a real-world application and enhanced my skills in problem-solving, software development, and project management.

## Additional Information
- **Internship Duration**: 30-60 days
- **Internship Type**: Remote internship
